            <h5>Background information is the additional information your reader needs to know to understand your work. It might include things like definitions, historical context, current events that have bearing on your writing, or other information. Background information does not directly support your thesis in an essay or paper, but it is necessary for your reader to understand your thesis.</h5>
            <h6 id="h6">How Do You Write Background Information in an Essay or Paper?
                How, and just as importantly, where, you write the background information can make or break your paper. Before you look at examples, think about your own essay and keep these tips in mind.
                
                Only Include the Background Information Your Reader Needs
                Including too much information risks overwhelming the reader and veering off topic. Including too little information means leaving your reader confused. The key is to consider your reader carefully and ask yourself a few questions:
                
                What does your reader already know about your topic?
                Will you be using jargon or specific terminology your reader may not know already?
                Does your reader need more context to truly understand your points?
                What is the minimum amount of background information you can provide that will give your reader the facts he or she needs?

                Only Share Background Information After the Hook
                Typically, the background information goes in your essay or research paper introduction, right after the hook. You need to capture the reader’s attention first with compelling details or quotes. Only after you have the attention of your audience can you afford to share the background details. If you share the details first, your reader may not continue reading.
                
                However, it’s also important to make sure you include the background information quickly in the introduction. If you wait until later in the body of the essay or paper, your reader may not fully understand your thesis.
